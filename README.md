# Pack.gml
A light-weight library to pack data and load it into function scope

# Why use it?
Basically it's like escaping your local variables into globals, except that it will 100% never mess up anything in your game and/or overwrite previous packed values + you don't have to bother making up names for the global variables

Basically, this lib is not necesseraly vital for a project, but it's rather just a good practice to use, when you want to pass a local variable into a function
